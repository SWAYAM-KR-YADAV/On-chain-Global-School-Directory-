          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            The Onchain Global School Directory is a decentralized application (dApp) 
            built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to register schools on-chain 
            and retrieve their details, ensuring transparency and accessibility in 
            school data management.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our vision is to create a globally accessible, decentralized, and tamper-proof 
            school directory that ensures accurate and verifiable school data. This will 
            help in improving trust and efficiency in the education sector.
          </p>
          <h3>Future Plans</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Adding more metadata for schools such as address, accreditation, and contact details.</li>
            <li>Implementing a verification system for school authenticity.</li>
            <li>Enabling search and filtering features for easier access to school data.</li>
            <li>Integrating with educational institutions and government bodies for official recognition.</li>
          </ul>
